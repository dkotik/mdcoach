# Top Heading

## Heading Types

Level one and two headings always split the slide without having to use a thematic break.

---

When a manual slide split is required, use dashes `---` on the same line to make a slide break.

## Notes

Thematic breaks made with asterisks designate notes attached to the previous slide. They are absent in the slide view, but present in the notes view.
